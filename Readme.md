## 🧭 Overview
This repository contains the assignments and daily practice work from the  
**Two-Week Dynamic Programming Training Session (Nov 4–18, 2025)**  
organized by **Galgotias College of Engineering and Technology**.

The goal of this training is to build strong problem-solving foundations using  
**Recursion**, **Backtracking**, and **Dynamic Programming**.  

All solutions are written in **JavaScript (ES6)** using recursive or backtracking approaches —  
no loops, no built-in combination/permutation utilities.
