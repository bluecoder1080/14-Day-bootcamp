##  Overview
This repository contains the assignment and daily practice work for  
**Day 1 – Recursion** from the *Two-Week Dynamic Programming Training Session (Nov 4–18, 2025)*  
organized by **Galgotias University**.

The goal is to understand how problems can be solved using **recursion**,  
focusing on **base cases**, **recursive cases**, and **call-stack logic**.  
All solutions are written in **JavaScript (ES6)** using **recursion only** — no loops.
